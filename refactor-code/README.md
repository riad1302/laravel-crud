#However, there are a few issues with the code:

- The constructor of the Car class is empty, so it doesn't initialize the $name property, resulting in a PHP notice when calling $this->name in the get_name() method.
- The $name property is not being set anywhere in the code, resulting in a null value being returned by get_name() method.
- The TeslaCar constructor is missing, so there's no way to pass a name to the Car constructor and initialize the $name property.
